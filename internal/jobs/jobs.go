// Package jobs implements detached generation — the /llm/jobs* API.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: chat.html used to hold the /llm streaming fetch open in the
// browser for the whole generation. Any navigation — new URL in the tab, tab
// close, phone screen lock — tore down that fetch, the proxy connection to
// llama.cpp collapsed, and the server cancelled the slot. The reply died with
// the page. No browser mechanism can reliably keep a cross-navigation SSE stream
// alive: service workers get frozen too, and mobile OSes kill backgrounded
// sockets within seconds.
//
// So the long-lived connection moves HERE, into the one process that never
// navigates away.
//
//	POST   /llm/jobs                        body is the exact chat/completions
//	                                        request. Returns {id} immediately.
//	GET    /llm/jobs/{id}?from=N[&max=M]    new bytes from offset N
//	POST   /llm/jobs/{id}/cancel            abort the upstream request
//	DELETE /llm/jobs/{id}                   client ack; drops the buffer
//
// The client polls, feeds the bytes through the SAME parser pipeline it uses for
// live streaming, and can reattach after a navigation and replay from byte 0
// with identical results.
//
// Buffering raw SSE bytes rather than parsed text is deliberate: thinking-format
// splitting, tool-call unwrapping and reasoning-field routing all stay in
// chat.html where they already live. This package stays a dumb, faithful pipe.
//
// The wire contract belongs to fileserver.ps1, which defined it, and the stock
// frontend is written against that. Poll chunks go out base64-encoded as
// chunk_b64; job ids stay 32 lowercase hex; the status vocabulary is unchanged.
// Deviating buys nothing and costs compatibility with the one client there is.
//
// What DOES differ is storage, and only because nothing observable depends on
// it: everything is held in memory. The PowerShell original spools to .jobs/
// with cancel-flag files because a runspace cannot share state with the
// listener; a goroutine can, so cancellation is a context and the spool is a
// bytes.Buffer. At ~150 tok/s a thirty-minute generation is single-digit
// megabytes, and finished jobs are held only until the client acks or the
// retention window expires. The visible consequence is that a restart drops
// jobs entirely (the client sees 404 → 'lost') where PowerShell reports them
// 'interrupted'; both are terminal and the frontend handles each.
//
// A POST past the concurrency cap SUPERSEDES rather than queues or refuses —
// see supersede(). The app has always been one generation at a time, and the
// server now enforces that instead of permitting a backlog llama.cpp cannot
// serve.
